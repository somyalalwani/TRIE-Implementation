# Data Structures & Algorithms for Problem Solving
# Trie Implementation
### AIM : Given an array A of N numbers, you will be given q queries. Each query will contain a single integer x. You have to find then maximum xor of x from any number in A.

### Constraints:
• 1 <= N, q <= 10 ^ 5
• 1 <= A[i] <= 10 ^ 12

#### Do not use any in-built data structures.

INPUT:
First Line contains N and q
Second line contains N space separated intergers.
Next q lines contain q queries of single integer

Example:
3 2
1 2 3
4
5
A = {1, 2, 3}
Case 1: x = 4 Maximum xor of x is with 3, therefore answer is 4 xor 3 = 7
Case 2: x = 5 Maximum xor of x is with 2, therefore answer is 5 xor 2 = 7
